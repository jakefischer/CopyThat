# CopyThat
Go program that copies barcodes
Contains functions to use both Brady and Zebra printers
The printing is handled via command line and the PrintFile program created by Peter Lerup (avaiable at https://www.lerup.com/mysoft.phtml)
For most installations the folder containing prfile32.exe must be added to the environments PATH
Also, a setting must be created in PrintFile called "Zebra" or "Brady" so PrintFile knows what printer to use.
